# Go Generate

web-api requires files that are generated by sqlc and oapi-codegen.
`//go generate:` comments are usually used with `go generate ./...` in a makefile
to ensure that builds run individual commands in the correct order.

## Alternatives Considered

1. use `//go generate:` to create files that we need (sqlc + oapi-codegen)
1. define tasks and task dependencies (build tree) in nx project.json file

## Decision

Since this monorepo uses nx workspaces, we should leverage its caching capabilities.
**Define individual generate tasks and list them in dependencies in the build / serve tasks.**
